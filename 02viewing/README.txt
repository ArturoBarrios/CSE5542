CSE 5542
Section 11:10

Used a WebGL wrapper known as Babylon.js for this assignment.
Created two cameras each with its own view to have dual-view from the perspective of the figure.
Implemented orthographic camera which has a bug where the view looks through the terrain. Not a problem when the cameras
is implemented as a perspective camera.
To run just open the index.html file in a web browser.
