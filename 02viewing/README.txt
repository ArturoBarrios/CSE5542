Section 11:10

Used a WebGL wrapper known as Babylon.js for this assignment.
Created two cameras each with its own view to have dual-view from the perspective of the figure.
Implemented orthographic camera which has a bug where the view looks through the terrain. Not a problem when the cameras
is implemented as a perspective camera. 


To view in perspective mode, just delete or comment out lines 60-64 and lines 69-73. 

To rotate camera, just move mouse while holding mouse down.

To move camera around:
  up arrow: move forward
  down arrow: move backwards
  left arrow: move left
  right arrow: move right

To run just open the index.html file in a web browser.
